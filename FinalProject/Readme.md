The final project involved developing a prototype of a robotic manipulator that would test new baseballs to be used by major league pitchers. The robotic manipulator proposed throws a ball from the pitchers mound to home plate, subject to the requirement that the ball is thrown at 60-80mph and within the strike box. 

My proposed manipulator was an anthropomorphic arm with 3 revolute joints and an end effector that releases the ball.  This report outlines the requirements of the robotic manipulator, following with the direct kinematics, inverse kinematics, geometric jacobian, and dynamics of the proposed manipulator.  All of these calculations are detailed in FinalP1.pdf.

Further, I created a Simulink simulation of a single-link manipulator (instead of the more complex 3-link manipulator) that uses classical position and velocity control to meet the pitching requirements.  Information about how the scripts were implemented to achieve this are provided in the report FinalP2.pdf.
